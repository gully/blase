## _Handles stellar and telluric lines simultaneously_

We can combine stellar, [telluric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluric_contamination), and instrumental models into a unified forward model of your entire high-bandwidth, high-resolution spectrum. We can obtain best-in-class models of Earth's atmosphere, line-by-line, automatically, for free (or cheap).

## _Massively scalable_

By using autodiff, we can fit over 10,000 spectral lines simultaneously. This enormous amount of flexibility is unavailable in conventional frameworks that do not have [autodiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation).

^ We do this for 10,000 lines simultaneously.

## _Rooted in physics_

We first clone a precomputed synthetic spectrum, such as PHOENIX, and then **transfer learn** with data. By regularizing to the cloned model, we get the best of both worlds: data driven when the Signal-to-Noise ratio is high, and model-driven when we lack data to say otherwise.

## _Blazing fast with GPUs_

We achieve $>60 \times$ speedups with NVIDIA GPUs, so training takes minutes instead of hours.
