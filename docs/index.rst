blasé
===========

The `blasé` project (pronounced "blah-say") aims to improve the astronomical echelle spectroscopy data analysis process through a hybrid data-driven/model-driven approach.  It is similar in spirit to `Starfish
<http://www.github.com/iancze/Starfish>`_, and `wobblé
<https://github.com/megbedell/wobble>`_.  The key design features of `blasé` include:


1. Built on a foundation of precomputed synthetic stellar spectra, chosen at discrete grid points
2. Extensible for a wide range of scientific applications
3. Handles stellar, telluric, and instrumental features simultaneously

We invite you to engage with us at our `GitHub page
<http://www.github.com/gully/blase>`_, with pull requests and discussions welcomed.
