Thanks to the referee once again for their feedback on this manuscript.
The only locations changed were the sentence starting at line 423, the last paragraph of section 4.2, and Figure 8, both chart and caption.
We use the same convention as previously; each comment has a response starting with '-'.

Line 423: The comparison in speed between between KORG and the PHEONIX generator is very helpful. However, line 426 then goes on to compare the parallelized version of the PHEONIX generator to the serial version of KORG, which I do not think is a fair comparison. In most realistic situations, a user would be able to run KORG using multiprocessing in a way that would see an effective 1/N_processes speedup on the serial times. I request that the manuscript either clarifies why parallel PHEONIX should be compared to serial KORG or remove lines 426-429.
- Good to know! Removed this comparison.

Paragraph starting on line 526 to the end of line 560, including Figure 8: The median Teff, logg, and [Fe/H] residual values are reported in the text, but they don't appear to agree (by eye) with the values shown in Figure 8. For example, I would not have guessed that the median of the logg or [Fe/H] residuals are 0 dex for Teff<7000K as mentioned in line 542. It could be because Figure 8 has averaged different (logg, [Fe/H]) pairs with the same Teff together and the median is quite different, but this is not explained in the figure caption or body of the text. I suggest that Figure 8 shows the results of individual tests (e.g. a line for each of the 10 logg,[Fe/H] pairs, with labels for those pairs) to make it clearer where the residual means, medians, and standard deviations quoted in the text come from. The lines currently shown in Figure 8 are still useful, but the caption should describe how the different (logg,[Fe/H]) pairs are combined to produce these lines (e.g. median or mean or weighted average).
- This is a really good catch, thank you so much! There was an error in my code where I took the median of the residual itself instead of the absolute residual. Thankfully, it seems this error was not present in the average absolute residuals computed in the paragraph prior, so those are still correct. Text has been changed to reflect these new numbers.
- Specified that we used a straightforward average in the caption. I tried plotting all 10 lines, but it looked extremely random and messy, and I feel the reader would be overwhelmed more than anything else if looking at that plot. I instead opted for what I hope you'll agree is a much cleaner and perhaps more visually insightful approach, with bars (these are notably NOT error bars, we are averaging over differently distributed variables) on each data point to show the spread (stdev) of the values that went into the average value calculation. This should still quantify the properties of the values going into the averages without overloading on information to the reader.
